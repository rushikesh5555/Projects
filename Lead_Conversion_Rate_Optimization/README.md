Project Title:
Lead Conversion Rate Optimization using Logistic Regression Model

Introduction:
This project report focuses on addressing the challenge faced by X Education in improving its lead conversion rate. By utilizing logistic regression modeling in Python, the objective was to identify the most promising leads, referred to as "Hot Leads," in order to allocate resources effectively and increase the conversion rate.

Objective:
The main objective of this project was to optimize the lead conversion rate for X Education by leveraging logistic regression modeling. By analyzing various factors, the aim was to identify key insights that contribute significantly to lead conversion and recommend a targeted approach to improve conversion rates.

Approach:
The below steps were undertaken to achieve the project objective:

1. Data Analysis: The dataset was analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables related to lead conversion. Key features were identified and analyzed to determine their impact on conversion rates.

2. Logistic Regression Modeling: Logistic regression modeling was implemented in Python to develop a predictive model. The model utilized the identified key features to calculate the probability of lead conversion.

3. Model Evaluation: The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated using various metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and accuracy. The model's ability to adjust to X Education's requirements was assessed based on its performance on both the train and test datasets.

Results:
The analysis and logistic regression modeling yielded the following key findings:

1. Maximum lead conversions occurred through Landing Page Submissions.
2. Leads sourced through Google resulted in the majority of conversions.
3. The Unemployed group exhibited a higher conversion rate compared to other occupation categories.
4. Features such as Total Visits, Total Time Spent on the Website, and Page Views Per Visit had a 5. significant impact on lead conversion.
6. Email campaigns were found to be effective in driving conversions.
